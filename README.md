**OneSky SDK for Web** offers a client library for developers to actualize localization effects with out-of-the-box solutions. The primary function of the library is managing language and region preferences for the end user, so that the appropriate localization effects can be displayed. The library includes a UI kit, and communicates with the [OneSky App API](https://developers.onesky.app/reference).

## Setup and Configuration
Our [installation guide](https://developers.onesky.app/docs/web-installation) contains full setup and initialization instructions.

## Sample Apps
